## MONEY

### Starting assets
- `¤5.000` in cash.
- 2 paintings of incalculable value
- a handshake agreement with a patron that they're buying one of your pieces for `¤5.000`
- 2 months pre-paid rent

### Rent
At the start of the game, you live in an apartment with 1 room for bed/work/living space, sharing a bathroom with 1 other apartment, and sharing a kitchen with 3 other apartments. It would be hell if it wasn't one block over from the very best coffee shop in town.

Your landlord can charge `¤10.000,-` per month for one room + shared amenities because somebody else claimed this land before you were even born. Wiwa li Rewoluzion!

### Paint
Your next-highest expense after rent is the ingredients you buy to mix paint. The higher your `chemistry` rank, the less money you have wasted ruining your ingredients. Add `¤1.000,-` to your starting assets for each rank in `chemistry`. (At `chemistry` rank `0`, you are assumed to buy all your paints pre-mixed and haven't saved a single `¤`)

### Income
Your income depends on `exposition` and `economics` - `exposition` determines how many potential clients you have reached, and `economics` determines how well that works out for you. Add `¤200 x exposition x economics,-` to your starting money.

### Other
Your `other` skill covers *literally every other skill it is possible to practice* and if you have a high rank in `other`, you spend a *lot* of money keeping in practice - going to the gym, attending meetings with secret societies, driving fast cars, keeping your world-class kitchen stocked. Each rank in `other` reduces your starting money by `¤3.000,-`
