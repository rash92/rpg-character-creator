# Aliens and Asteroids
*Get rich or die trying - in space!*

Your starting Star Count (SC) is 1.

- Landing
- Lasering (Mounted laser)
- Lasering (Hand laser)
- Leaping
- Lifting off
- Liquidizing
- Losing

## Step 3: Experience

Each track is associated with skills. For each skill, roll 1d100 and replace your old score with the new score (only if the new score is higher.)

  - Losing
- Pilot (Merchant ship)
  - Lasering (Hand Laser)
  - Liquidizing

  - Landing
  - Lasering (Mounted laser)
  - Lifting off
- Soldier
  - Lasering (Mounted laser)
  - Lasering (Hand laser)

If none of your skills improved, you probably died in there at some point. Start over from step 1.

Add 1 to your SC for each skill you have at 95 or higher.
Add 1 to your SC for each skill you have at 99 or higher.
Add 1 to your SC for each skill you have at 100.

Roll 1d100. If you rolled lower than your SC, a powerful rival fears your power and arranges to have you killed. Start over from step 1.

If you did not die, go to step 4 (Skill assessment)

## Step 4: Skill assessment

If you are unsatisfied with your character, go get some more experience (step 3).

If you are satisfied with your character, go to finishing touches (step 5).

## Step 5: Finishing touches

**Star Count and Money**

You have a Credit Score (CS) equal to Star Count. You may reduce your CS by 2 to borrow 1 million Space Credits (SC)

**Financing a spaceship**

Your company's spaceship budget is calculated as follows:

- The bank will let you borrow 1 million Space Credits to buy a ship. (with the space ship as collateral)
- Select the player with the highest CS (break ties randomly each time you go to this step)
- The selected player is offered another million to loan, (collateralized against the space ship, reducing CS by 1)
  - Repeat the selection and loan offer until a loan is refused.
- Stop. If the player with the *highest credit score* thinks it's a bad idea to borrow more money, the banks agree and will not let you borrow any more money against the spaceship.
- Any player may add additional money at regular uncollateralized borrowing rates.
- The player that contributed the most money towards the spaceship decides who the captain is.
